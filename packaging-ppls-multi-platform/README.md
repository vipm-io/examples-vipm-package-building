# Packagoing PPLs (Multi-Platform)

Problem Statement:

> I'm building a toolkit that has 32-bit and 64-bit versions of a few ppls. I want one single VIP that can target either/both LabVIEW bitnesses but I don't think VIP Builder supports this? (VIPM 2020). Do I need two VIP packages - one for 32-bit one for 64-bit?
> Found this forum post suggesting it's possible with the aid of some unreleased tools from Jim: https://forums.vipm.io/topic/4235-how-to-build-vi-packages-which-supports-multiple-target-platforms/ Haven't looked at those tools yet - wanted to check in first - is this supported yet?
