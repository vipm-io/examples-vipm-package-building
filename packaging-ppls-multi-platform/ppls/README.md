# Packaging PPLs (Multi-Platform)

Create all versions of your PPL with an appropriate suffix to denote the target
Keep them alongside one another.
Ensure an original .lvlibp remains - it will be overridden with the target-appropriate copy
For example, sample_ppl.lvlibp.windows_x64 will be used to overwrite sample_ppl.lvlibp on LabVIEW for Windows 64-bit installations.
